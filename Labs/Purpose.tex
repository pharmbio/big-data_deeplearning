Purpose of labs:
- Learn how to code simple models
- Explore how different hyperparameters affect the results
- Learn new concepts most relevant to coding 
    - E.g. regularisation methods, normalisation methods

- Crucially: see how concepts interact with the theory so that they can be remembered/ quickly explained on exam


Purpose of Assignments:
- Explore how to make and improve a (simple) models
- Reiterate theory in relation to practical application (deeper/broader understanding of concepts)
- Examine understanding of concepts
- Get feedback on how concepts are implied (and corrections on misunderstood concepts)

Purpose of Exam:
- Test that the individual student understands deep learning by answering one question with solid theoretical basis
