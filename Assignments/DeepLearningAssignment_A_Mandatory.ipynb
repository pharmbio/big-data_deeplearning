    "## Story \n",
    "Your boss at BestEverLifeScienceCompany, or BELSC, was quite impressed with your latest work on the white blood cells and wants to pursue that as a potential software feature to sell with the new instrument the lab is developing. During a quick meeting you've tried explaining that if there's a new machine being developed you cannot guarantee that the model you develop now will work on the new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your boss still wants a better proof of concept on the data you do have from the old machine in order to convince the top bosses that this project is worth pursuing and your group should have a 2 day conference to team build with the lab this summer. Your BELSC boss would really like to go before the summer holiday, so your deadline is the 15th of May. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since you have explained earlier that determining what's actually important in an image isn't always easy for a neural network, the boss spoke to the lab and you've recieved masks made by experts. Your bosses boss have heard about a couple cool \"new\" networks, and so you'll have to show results from those networks wether you think they're a good idea or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you get the data you realise that this data looks nothing like your old data, so you decide to only train on this new dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your boss has helpfully added a list of questions that need to be answered by your work in order for the project to be approved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summer holidays are right around the corner, and you might go into it with all your work done.\n",
    "Good luck!\n"
