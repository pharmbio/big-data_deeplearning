### Clone this repo to your pod, see notebook section below. You can open terminals in your pod, e.g. during cloning, but we will primarily work in notebooks.

## Unzip the data before you start the lab
To unzip the data in the LabData folder use the command `tar -xvf` which you used in the storage lab.
